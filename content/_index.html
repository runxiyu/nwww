			What I value the most [...], is not freedom of speech. It's not the freedom to express myself. It's not the freedom to choose to perform a particular action in a given system. What I value the most is the freedom of association, the ability to escape systems of tyranny&mdash;the ability to think and act in terms of "I don't like this employer/school/country, so allow me to leave and be where I wish, or to establish that of my own". It's not even the ramifications of being a silent protest; it's the prospect of being able to choose which system to associate myself with. But that is precisely the type of freedom that the world denies us from. There is no saying, "I don't like this world, so allow me to leave".
