title: Leasing for romantic relationships

I propose something like the following for people who want to establish
romantic relationships.

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL
NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**,  **MAY**, and
**OPTIONAL** in this document are to be interpreted as described in
[RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119.html).

1. The relationship is a *lease*, and automatically ends on a
   pre-determined date. Let this date be known as the *release date*.
2. The lease **MAY** be *renewed*, but the following conditions
   **MUST** be met:
   (a) both parties agree; and
   (b) it is sufficiently close to the release date.
3. The release date **MUST** never be too far away, e.g. the initial
   lease and any renewals **SHOULD NOT** set the release date to more
   than 32 days from now.
4. Parties to the relationship **SHOULD NOT** convey any promise, or
   develop any expectation, that the relationship would last "forever".

(Please do not take this seriously.)
