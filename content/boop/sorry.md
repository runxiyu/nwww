title: Sorry
---

&lt;rant&gt;

I am really sorry that I am incapable of surviving in a place where people have
to screech and yell and curse for every single fucking thing and absolutely
ignore any request, polite or not, for them to calm down and give a little bit
of respect. I am also frankly tired of the contemporary political discourse
where people from both sides of the improperly linearized spectrum are talking
past each other and almost never try to reach a consensus on anything. I don't
understand what's the deal with people trying to prevent or criminalize it when
other people wish to cease their own lives. I am disgusted of the blatant lies
they present to us about our purported rights and the contrived pretexts they
present to us every time we ask for some form of equity and equal protection.

I'm not sure if this is too much. But of course, *I* should be sorry for all of
this as it was intended to be. Not by God, not by any corollary of nature, but
by the prevailing opinion of what is right or wrong. Perhaps it all boils down
to "oh it's an incompatibility". Or perhaps not, for I am sure that they are
right, and I am not.

&lt;/rant&gt;
