title: Smush
---

Begone the shallow fears and\
Behind the unveiled face\
There exists a skeleton\
Consisting of two hun-\
dred something bones\
Skull cracked and shredded\
Pinkish tissue irritably hopping\
Oozing out of the seams\
As if someone had dumped\
A jar of red watercolor\
Mixed with fresh lubricant

Bubbles of thoughts and memories\
And desire and living and haps\
Slowly emerging from the cerebrospinal\
Goo, forming the occasional grid that\
Seems to resemble a plate, a bell jar\
A jar that I could see through, a jar\
With a sharp unicorn's horn sticked\
Hastily on top of it with\
Cheap glue and duct tape

And the decaying flesh\
Fills the jar.\
Rotten, with its lurid colors\
Decomposed aimlessly,\
shedding fragments onto the\
glass and cotton jar wall

I carefully wrap the jar in an\
opaque paper box\
then another stainless steel box\
then another matte wood box\
then a gift wrapper\
Shiny, but covered with soothing colors\
I print a sticker in 12-point Century font:\
"Life"\
and stick it onto the wrapper.

Here you go. Your gift.
