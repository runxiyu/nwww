title: The Onion
---

I peeled the onion\
A layer shredded\
Sent to oblision\
Yet I dreaded\
The heart of\
The warped\
Onion

With tis stained magenta glass surface\
Amalgamating with every droplet\
Of tears\
Into each word engraved in my sight

I dropped the onion

Destitute of hope and love and faith

I walked away

I turned back

I picked it up again.
