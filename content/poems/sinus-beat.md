title: Sinus beat
draft: true

When my last sinus cell fires,\
I shall still be alive.

When the door shuts,\
The lights switched off,\
The candle goes out,\
The unicorn shattered,\
The tuplips shiver in the austere cold,

When my chest wall collapses,\
When the last drop of blood is pumped through my aorta,\
I shall still be alive
