I am\
&emsp;fluctuating\
&emsp;&emsp;between two extremes

one extremely sticky spongy\
&emsp;with its childish desire to be seen\
&emsp;&emsp;to be heard\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to be loved\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;to drain

one extremely dry and separated\
&emsp;with its sublime illusion\
&emsp;&emsp;distancing itself from everyone\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;distancing itself from the “other”\
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;distancing itself from the “self”

deconstruct\
reconsolidate
