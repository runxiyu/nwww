It is, I suppose, a particular kind of catharsis. The kind that lets me
grasp my chest and squeeze the blood out of it and experience some sort
of, well, exhilarating pain. Pain that feels like it could transcend my

limitations of being a human being. It's a powerful form of escape, one
that I fear when sober, but cling on to when desperate.
