As the chill autumn wind begin caressing my trunk,\
I gently rest my hands on my cleavage and sigh.\
I fantasize about using adenosine to halt my heart,\
To drown and fall through the misty abyss and\
Cracking two hundred and six bones\
Crashing and crushing that brittle and fragile skull\
Exposing that red plush and dark, maroon, blood.

I still dream about sleep&mdash;death&mdash;tranquility\
Because subconsciously what lingers\
Is the narrative that *death is peace*\
That *living is bloodshed and agony*\
That sleep is a ceasefire while death is an armistice.

I was, I am, making every effort, to resist that\
Faint muffled smell serenity temptingly promised.\
I'd like to leave no epilogue and\
Erase those revolting footprints and memories\
Somehow attributed to me.

Mortality yields immortality, I thought.
