I am\
A faint glow tarnishing and polluting the\
&emsp;faithless vacuum\
A faint glow to be extinguished and filled\
&emsp;with a luxuriously inert peace.

Threads spawn, clone, fork, map, and\
&emsp;stop, terminate, abort, and end.

Scorched Earth has buried the immobile corpses\
and silently made them immortal.

It's a chronic yearning for peace and tranquility,\
one granted to you only by the silent stare of the abyss.\
You could choose to walk into it.\
Or let it slowly, gently flow dissipate through you,\
Crossing your eyelids and engulfing you from your back.\
Either way,\
&emsp;you,\
shall be happy and content\
&emsp;for your agency has concluded,\
I've dismantled your skeleton, piece by piece.

When the epistle of life ends\
we will be cast into a faintly yellowed envelope,\
one cherished and embellished with love.
