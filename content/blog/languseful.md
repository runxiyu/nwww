title: Declaring languages in project titles considered useful

Often times I hear people say that it's unnecessary, or even harmful, to
declare the language/framework in a project's description. I dissent from
this argument based on one very simple fact:

**They are a useful filter to determine which projects I wish to prioritize
taking a look at, which projects I could possibly hack on, and which libraries
I could use.**

* I do not enjoy cloning a repository and figuring out that it only supports
  C++, when I was looking for a C library.
* Anything written in Go is, in my experience, quite pleasant to hack on. Most
  Go code I read is quite idiomatic and well-documented.
* Python code generally has a wide range of quality to expect from.
* I am willing to hack on projects written in Rust, but I need to spend extra
  time to do so, along with ensuring that I have my more powerful laptop nearby
  as compiling and using Rust is particularly painful on my slower machines
  running OpenBSD.
* I am generally unable and unwilling to hack on projects written in Node.js,
  Ruby on Rails, PHP, C#/.NET, C++, and many other languages/frameworks.
* I cannot run server software written in Node.js due to RAM constraints.

I am familiar with particular languages and "frameworks". I don't always have
the time to learn something completely new to hack on a project. Many of the
"stereotypical" performance characteristics of certain languages/frameworks
(yes, Node.js) are quite representative of most programs written in it.
