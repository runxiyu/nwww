title: On racist jokes

(This page was originally written as a response to an event that
occurred in my year group at school. It has since became less of a
current issue but my point still stands.)

The use of the terms "black" and "black slave" as insults is:

-   profoundly disrespectful towards the millions of black people that
    have been abused, discriminated against, and treated unfairly, in
    the past and the present
-   ill-considerate towards people who are experiencing racism
-   demonstrates a toxic and arrogant lack of empathy towards the
    disadvantaged.

A common argument to make here is that "consider how you would be
discriminated against when you become the minority, you wouldn't
appreciate such jokes on your social group". Although we head in the
same general direction, I do not agree with this frame of mind.
Discriminatory jokes are wrong, independent of the possibility of the
discriminator being held to the same activities in the future.

The argument to "take this easy as these are just jokes" is ridiculous.
The mere act of descriptive terms for a specific social group being used
as a "joke" undermines the seriousness of the social issue. Find
something else to joke about. Not something like racism and other forms
of discrimination.

It is similarly bad to direct hatred towards others who fight against
racism.
