These are some general recommendations that I believe make communicating
with me, at least, easier and/or more effective, including communication
conventions that make my life easier. Please note that what I prefer may
not be what others prefer and shall not be treated as a general
guideline for communications, although many of these are common in the
free software community.

1.  Write a descriptive subject for emails. Do not send emails with an
    empty subject or no subject header. The subject should be give the
    receiver a brief idea of what the email is about.
2.  Send complete information. When telling me something or requesting
    something, please provide complete background information, knowledge
    required, and other relevant context. This prevents back-and-forth
    communication along the lines of "and now I need to know ... but you
    didn't tell me that so can you please give that to me". Providing
    context defragments conversations which increases efficiency.
3.  When using instant messaging such as IRC, do not split one sentence
    into multiple messages (unless, of course, if your message exceeds
    the character limit). Fragmentation reduces readability.
4.  Do not use excessive emojis.
5.  Be direct rather than polite. As the sender, do not use polite
    expressions like "you did quite well in that presentation" when in
    reality, the sender believes that the presentation is not "quite
    well". Direct critique and suggestions are very welcome here.
    Politeness is acceptable if it does not interfere with honest
    conveying of information.
6.  [Don't ask to ask.](./ask.html)
7.  Use plain text email. Both hard-wrapped and non-hard-wrapped emails
    are acceptable. If you do hard-wrap, please wrap at 72 characters
    for English. Chinese, if hard-wrapped, should be at approximately 36
    characters. Non hard-wrapped emails should [specify format=flowed
    according to RFC3676](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3676.txt).
8.  Interweave the original message with the response when replying to
    an email and remove irrelevant parts (i.e. greetings, closings,
    signatures, etc.) of the quoted original email.
