May the ashes of my heart drift gently into the abyss of memory, and let that
memory consolidate. A bright dot embellishing that unicorn&rsquo;s horn. Then
that glimmer of light shall decay, vaporize, and taint the glass walls of my
body. Gently running a cloth under my skin, I wipe away every atom of that
stain. Every, single, one. I stare at the cloth, with rainbows seeping into its
fabric, assimilating into my body yet again.
