title: Declaring languages in project titles considered useful

Often times I hear people say that it's unnecessary, or even harmful, to
declare the language/framework in a project's description. I dissent from
this argument based on one very simple fact:

**They are a useful filter to determine which projects I wish to prioritize
taking a look at, which projects I could possibly hack on, and which libraries
I could use.**

* I do not enjoy cloning a repository and figuring out that it only supports
  C++, when I was looking for a C library.
* Anything written in Go is, in my experience, quite pleasant and rewarding to
  hack on.
* I am willing to hack on projects written in Rust, but I need to spend extra
  time to do so, along with ensuring that I have my more powerful laptop nearby
  and that I'm booted into an environment suitable for writing Rust.
* I am unable and unwilling to hack on projects written in Node.js, Ruby on
  Rails, PHP, C#/.NET, C++, and many other languages/frameworks.
