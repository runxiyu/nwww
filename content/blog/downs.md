title: Please stop mocking Down's Syndrome

It has been a while since the onset of this rather unfortunate pattern,
but the use of "Âîê" and its derivative "üç¨" to address whatever
day-to-day behavior that they seem to be used to refer to, is quite
infuriating.

[Down's Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_syndrome) is a
genetic disorder. [Patients nearly always have some type of
disability.](https://books.google.com/books?id=0Y20AQAAQBAJ&pg=PA5)
Mockery and discrimination towards people with Down's Syndrome is
therefore a type of [ableism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ableism).

Please stop clowning around with exlamations that create random and
unsupported references to Down's Syndrome, or, in fact, any other
condition that may correlate to disabilities. This behavior is
disgusting, profoundly disrespectful, uneducated, rude, impudent, etc.
It demonstrates a toxic and arrogant lack of empathy towards people with
Down's Syndrome.

But what about freedom of speech?

Interesting point, but mind the difference between what is *legal* and
what is *right*. By the text of the statutes this may be legal, but note
[the historical background of the 1st
amendment](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/amendment-1/freedom-of-speech-historical-background)‚Äînote
that most clauses relating to freedom of speech intended to disallow
limitations on political speech as to prevent a tyranny of government. I
don't see how shouting "Down's Syndrome" at everything fits into any
valid political purpose.
