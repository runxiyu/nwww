WeChat is a instant messaging program by the Chinese technology giant
Tencent. It is insanely popular in Mainland China.

It sucks.

-   WeChat's client program is [nonfree
    software](https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.html).
-   Many of WeChat's features are [Service as a Software
    Substitute](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/who-does-that-server-really-serve.html).
-   WeChat's servers are nonfree; the service is centralized.
-   Tencent suspends WeChat accounts for sending "politically sensitive
    chats".
-   Information collected by WeChat is given to the police of the PRC
    without court warrants.
-   etc.

Similar problems are present in other popular Instant Messaging services
such as [WhatsApp](https://stallman.org/whatsapp.html),
[Discord](https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/discord.html), Tencent
QQ, etc.
