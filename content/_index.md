<b>Poppies in October</b><br/>
<i>By Sylvia Plath</i>

Even the sun-clouds this morning cannot manage such skirts.<br/>
Nor the woman in the ambulance<br/>
Whose red heart blooms through her coat so astoundingly &mdash;

A gift, a love gift<br/>
Utterly unasked for<br/>
By a sky

Palely and flamily<br/>
Igniting its carbon monoxides, by eyes<br/>
Dulled to a halt under bowlers.

O my God, what am I<br/>
That these late mouths should cry open<br/>
In a forest of frost, in a dawn of cornflowers.
